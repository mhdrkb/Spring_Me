#bean lays in Ioc container
#Bean or object instantiate is also a task of IOC
#in IOC i can inject properties value in tew ways, 1) costructor based, 2) getter setter based
	IOC container contains the object of a bean, the bean can be created in xml or fava file.
	if i need to read the object of the  bean class i need to read the ioc first,
	to do so,
		i need to create a ClassPathResourse for the xml or java file for resourse using Resourse,
		then i need to create a bean factory at the through of rosourse,
		then using the factory object i can call the getBean("call by the xml bean id name") method to read bean object from IOC as the object of the class.
